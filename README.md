# Solar Tracker Shield and LDR Board

Solar Tracker Shield is a half-size Arduino Uno board with a screw terminal connector. 

The Light-Detecting Resistor (LDR) Board is a board with four photocells and a matching screw terminal connector. 

The two boards should be connected by running individual wires between the two connectors, which can be tightened with a jeweler's screwdriver.

Note: it's much cheaper to just buy one 40-pin 0.1"-pitch male header and break it into pieces that are 6, 8, 8, 4, 3, and 3 pins wide.
