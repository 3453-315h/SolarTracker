# Dual Axis Solar Tracker V2 Hardware Files

## Hardware

Majority of screws are 3/4th inch 8-32 pan screws, one half inch 8-32 screw, one 2.5 inch 8-32 screw, along with four Number 2 wood screws to mount the servo horns, and two M3 screws to mount the Arduino Uno.  Rubber feet are necessary for the bottom of the base.

## Laser Cut Files

Use a laser cutter or CNC router to cut the parts out. Use 1/4th inch and 1/8th inch plywood, not acrylic, for this project. A 1 inch by 1 inch reference square has been put on the laser cut design to help with any weird importing problems that may pop up.

## Solar Tracker Shield and LDR Board

[Solar Tracker Shield](hardware/Arduino-Shield) is a half-size Arduino Uno board with male pin headers for Servos and a Ribbon Cable. 

[The Light-Detecting Resistor (LDR) Board](hardware/LDR-Board) is a board with four photocells and a matching screw terminal connector. 

The two boards should be connected by running individual wires between the two connectors, which can be tightened with a jeweler's screwdriver.
