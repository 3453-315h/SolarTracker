The Single Axis Tracker is a more simple version of the solar tracker.

While it does utilize the same Sensor break out board that the Dual Axis Tracker uses, we are using a Crazy Circuits Robotics Board (Arduino Nano) instead of an Uno and Shield.

The project uses a single large servo to rotate the entire project X axis (East to West).  Users manually control the angle of the solar panel.

Users can also use a small 6V solar cell to power an LED volt meter to take measurements.  

Code is identical to the code found with the Single Axis tracker.
